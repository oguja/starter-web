Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind.

Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?
